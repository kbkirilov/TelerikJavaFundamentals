/*
Description
Write a program that, for a given two numbers N and X, calculates the sum S = 1 + 1!/x + 2!/x2 + â€¦ + N!/xN.

Use only one loop. Print the result with 5 digits after the decimal point.
Each element is calculated as follows: (previous_element) * i / x
Input
On the first line you will receive one number - N.
On the second line you will receive another number - X.
Output
Output only one number - the sum of the sequence for the given N and X.
Constraints
N will always be a valid integer between 2 and 10, inclusive.
X will always be a valid floating-point number between 0.5 and 100
